# Rubix-Cube-AI
This is just a simple repository for my rubix cube shuffler/solver. The Cube can be edited to any size. The default size is a standard 3x3 Rubix Cube, but I have managed to get it to solve a 101x101 on my old laptop. Follow me for more repos like this!

# Running
Simply Download processing 3 and open a file from this repo. Then hit the play button and watch!
If you want to change the size of the Cube, just look at line 8 and change the int!
